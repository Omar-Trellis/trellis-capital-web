## Architecture Overview

This is a React SPA for Trellis Capital Group built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application serves real estate investors and sellers.

### Tech Stack
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4 with React SWC plugin
- **Framework**: React 18.3 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (client-side)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (50+ pre-built components in `src/components/ui/`)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber and Drei
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Touch Gestures**: Custom swipe detection for mobile

### Project Structure
- `/src/pages/` - Route components (Home, Investors, Sellers, Contact, PitchDeck, NotFound)
- `/src/components/` - Reusable components and UI library
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useParallax, useIntersectionObserver, useCountUpAnimation, usePerformanceMonitor)
- `/src/data/` - Static data files (caseStudies.ts, teamData.ts)
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions
- Default route now displays professional Home page

### Key Patterns
1. **Component Architecture**: Modular components with shadcn/ui as the base UI library
2. **Path Aliases**: Use `@/` for imports (maps to `./src/`)
3. **TypeScript**: Relaxed type checking enabled (noImplicitAny: false, strictNullChecks: false)
4. **Styling**: Tailwind with CSS variables for theming, Montserrat as primary font
5. **Animations**: Custom Tailwind animations (fade-in, fade-up, slide-left, slide-right, scale-in, glow, pulse-slow)
6. **Professional Design**: Enhanced color scheme with navy blues (navy-600 to navy-900) and bronze accents (bronze-400 to bronze-600)

### Performance Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: IntersectionObserverManager for shared observer instances
- **Lazy Loading**: React.lazy() for heavy components, progressive image loading
- **Animation Optimization**: RAF-based counters instead of Framer Motion for better performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: CSS transforms for smooth animations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in hooks for tracking Core Web Vitals

### Development Notes
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled via Vite
- IPv6 support enabled for development server
- Lovable tagger active in development mode for component tracking
- No test framework currently configured
- Originally created with Lovable.dev visual development platform
